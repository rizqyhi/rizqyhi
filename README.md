## Aloha, I'm Rizqy ðŸ‘‹

I'm an adventurer geek. On daily basis, I craft solutions to help solve people's problems, mostly in the form of websites. When not crafting, I'm a truck driver across Europe in ETS 2. Occasionally, I love to go outside. Hiking a mountain preferably, but lately forest bathing is well enough.
